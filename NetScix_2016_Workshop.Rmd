## Reading network data from files
# Dataset 1: edgelist
```{r}
nodes = read.csv("dataset/Dataset1-Media-Example-NODES.csv", header = T, as.is = T)
edges = read.csv("dataset/Dataset1-Media-Example-EDGES.csv", header = T, as.is = T)

head(nodes)
head(edges)

nrow(nodes)
length(unique(nodes$id))

nrow(edges)
nrow(unique(edges[,c("from", "to")]))
```


Collapse all links of the same type between the same two nodes by summing their weights, using aggregate() by “from”, “to”, & “type”. 
```{r}
edges = aggregate(edges[,3], edges[,-3], sum)
edges = edges[order(edges$from, edges$to),]
colnames(edges)[4] = "weight"
rownames(edges) = NULL
head(edges)
```


# Dataset 2: matrix
```{r}
nodes_user = read.csv("dataset/Dataset2-Media-User-Example-NODES.csv", header = T, 
                      as.is = T)
edges_user = read.csv("dataset/Dataset2-Media-User-Example-EDGES.csv", header = T, 
                      row.names = 1)

head(nodes_user)
head(edges_user)
```

```{r}
edges_user = as.matrix(edges_user)
dim(edges_user)
```
