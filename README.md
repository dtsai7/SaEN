# Social and Economic Networks


### Key Concepts
Basic Definitions
  - nodes
  - edges
  - directed network 
  - undirected network
  - weighted directed network ("row stochastic")
  - path
  - cycle
  - geodesic (shortest path between two nodes)
  
Different types of networks
  - Basic
  - General
  - Temporal
  - Bipartite

Properties of complex networks
  - power law distributed
  - strong and weak ties
  - high clustering
  - small world

Network Datasets
  - Collaboration Graphs
  - Who-talks-to-whom Graphs
  - Information Linkage Graphs
  - Technological Networks
  - Networks in the Natural World
  
Strong and Weak Ties
  - Triadic Closure
  - The Strength of Weak Ties
  - Tie Strength and Network Structure in Large-Scale Data
  - Tie Strength, Social Media, and Passive Engagement
  - Closure, Structural Holes, and Social Capital
  - Advanced Material: Betweenness Measures and Graph Partitioning
  
Connectionist Features vs. Positional Features
  - connectionist feaures: features emerging from the configuration of its ties. system-level features. 
  - common connectionist features: density, average path length, transitivity, clustering, degree distribution

  - positional features: node-level properties associated with occupying a particular place or performing a particualr role in a network. 
  - common positional features: degree, closness centrality, betweeness centrality, eigenvector centrality
